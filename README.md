🔥 **Amazing — you’re absolutely ready for this next step!**
Here’s a **real beginner-to-intermediate project** that will pull *everything* you just learned into a single, realistic, practical Python package — with **file I/O**, **unit tests**, **OOP**, **environments**, **Git**, and a proper `src/` structure.

---

## ✅ **Your Project: Personal Expense Tracker**

**Goal:**
Build a **command-line expense tracker** that lets a user:

* Add expenses with a category, amount, and date
* Save expenses to a CSV file
* Load and display total spending per category
* Show total expenses for a given month or date range
* Use OOP for expense records and the manager
* Add unit tests for your methods
* Use Git and a clear project structure

---

## 📌 **Project Description**

**Your app should do this:**

1️⃣ **Add an expense**

* Ask the user for: *date* (ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`), *category* (like `"Groceries"`), and *amount*.
* Validate input: date must be valid, amount must be positive.

2️⃣ **Save expenses**

* Each expense is saved to a `expenses.csv` file.
* If the file doesn’t exist, create it with headers: `date,category,amount`.

3️⃣ **Load expenses**

* On start, load all expenses from `expenses.csv` into a list of `Expense` objects.

4️⃣ **Report**

* Calculate and print total spending by category.
* Calculate total spending for a given month or date range.

5️⃣ **OOP structure**

* `Expense` class → represents one expense.
* `ExpenseManager` class → holds a list of expenses and has methods for:

  * `add_expense()`
  * `save_to_file()`
  * `load_from_file()`
  * `report_by_category()`
  * `report_by_date_range()`

6️⃣ **Unit tests**

* Use `pytest` in a `tests/` folder.
* Test adding an expense.
* Test loading from file.
* Test reports return correct totals.

7️⃣ **CLI**

* Have a `main.py` with an `if __name__ == "__main__":` that:

  * Loads expenses.
  * Shows a menu:

    ```
    1. Add expense
    2. Show total by category
    3. Show total by date range
    4. Quit
    ```

  * Calls your methods accordingly.

8️⃣ **Project structure**

```
expense_tracker/
├── pyproject.toml (or requirements.txt)
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── src/
│   └── expense_tracker/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── manager.py
│       └── models.py
├── tests/
│   └── test_manager.py
├── data/
│   └── expenses.csv
└── main.py
```

---

## 📌 **Bonus**

* Use a `venv` or `conda` environment.
* Commit with Git regularly:

  * Add `.gitignore` to exclude `.venv/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `__pycache__/`, etc.
* Write a clear `README.md` that explains:

  * How to run the app
  * How to run the tests
  * What it does

---

## ✅ **Skills you’ll use**

* ✅ OOP design with classes and methods
* ✅ File I/O with CSV
* ✅ Exception handling
* ✅ Unit testing with `pytest`
* ✅ Virtual environments
* ✅ Git version control
* ✅ Clear project structure

---

## 🟢 **What you’ll get**

By finishing this, you’ll have a **real, fully functional Python CLI app** that:

* Organizes your code cleanly
* Uses real data
* Has real tests
* Runs anywhere with `python main.py`
* Makes you comfortable with the full dev cycle

If you’d like, I can:
✔️ help you **scaffold the files**
✔️ write a starting `Expense` class
✔️ or help you make your `.gitignore` and `README`
Just say **“Let’s start!”** 🚀

Perfect — **“Tracker Project”** noted! ✅
That’s a fantastic plan — this will be a *real* project you can show off.

Whenever you have a question — about code design, structure, Git steps, tests, CSV quirks, OOP tricks — just say **“Tracker Project”** and what you need help with, and I’ll jump right in.

🚀 **Good luck — and have fun building it!**
